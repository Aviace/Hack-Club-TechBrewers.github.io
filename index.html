            I am the chair of SKN IEEE Student Branch (SKN-ISB). Our Student Branch had invited Mrunank Pawar the Lead
            of Club TechBrewers to conduct a workshop on Spark-AR. This collaboration workshop was conducted
            successfully and neatly. It was a very interactive responsive session. The conduction was very well managed
            and held by Mrunank Pawar and Team along with SKN ISB Team. It was indeed a great session! We would love to
            collaborate once again if the opportunity presents itself in the near future!

            Mrunank and his team handles everything with perfection. I personally learnt a lot from the sessions which
