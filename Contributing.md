# How to make your first pull request on GitHub

## What is forking?
When we love someone’s repository and would like to have it in our GitHub account, we fork it so that we can work with it separately.
When we fork a repository, we get an instance of that entire repository with its whole history. After forking, we can do whatever we want to do without affecting the original version.

## What is a pull request?
Pull requests are the way we contribute to group projects or open source projects.
For instance, a user Harry forks a repository of ThanoshanMV and makes changes to that repository. Now Harry can make a pull request to ThanoshanMV, but it’s up to ThanoshanMV to accept or decline it. It’s like saying, “ThanoshanMV, would you please pull my changes?”

## What it means to contribute?
Not only can we contribute to an open source project with code, but we can also contribute in many other ways. Some of these ways are described below.
We can contribute to an open source project in the following ways:

1. Designing: You can construct the layouts of a project to improve its usability, improve the project’s navigation and menu based on user research programs, create art for logos or t-shirts, and provide style guides for the project.
2. Writing: You can write and improve the project’s documentation or translate the documentation, start a newsletter for the project or write tutorials for the project and curate highlights from the mailing list, or curate a folder of examples showing how the projects are used.
3. Organizing: You can link duplicate issues, suggest new issue labels, suggest to close old open issues and ask questions on recently opened issues to move the discussion forward.
4. Help others: Answer questions on open issues, review code on other people’s submissions and offer to mentor another contributor.
5. Coding: Help solve any open issues, ask if you can provide any new features and improve tooling and testing.
